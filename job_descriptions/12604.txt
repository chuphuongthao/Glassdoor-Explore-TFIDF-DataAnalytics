Welcome to defining AI empathy
Empathy is for everyone. mpathic believes empathy is the key to innovation. We help people and organizations develop skills for greater understanding, compassion, and insight via AI-powered analytics, correction, and training of empathy.
mpathic is looking for a specialist in Machine Learning Operations to streamline and optimize our model building pipeline.

ML Ops
ML Ops is a set of practices that combines Machine Learning and DevOps, which aims to deploy and maintain ML systems in production reliably and efficiently. As an ML Ops engineer, you'll be a part of a small, high-impact team that works closely together. We are refining an AI system that can provide analysis and empathic corrections for text and audio conversations, kind of like spell check but for empathy.
