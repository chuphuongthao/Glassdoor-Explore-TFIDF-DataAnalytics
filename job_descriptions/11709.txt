Equivalent Experience

** FULLY REMOTE**
Description:
Boldt is currently looking for a new Data Analytics Manager. Their former Data Analytics Manager recently moved into a different role for the company. Boldt is pretty much right at the beginning of their data warehouse journey and are starting to integrate their construction and safety data into a data warehouse. Since they are right at the beginning, they are looking for someone that can interface with upper management, understand their needs and then build the roadmap to get their data warehouse up and running. Another piece of the job will be Power BI related. They currently have 850 active Power BI licenses but only 225 people are actually using it. This person will be tasked with helping different departments and people understand why they should be using it, which instances to use it, and how to use it effectively. They know that they'll never get to all 850 people actually using Power BI, but they know that there are many people that could be leveraging the tool that are not leveraging it because they don't know how or when to properly use it. Their ideal candidate would be someone that has build a data warehouse, has led smaller teams of 2-5 employees, and has experience working with both Power BI and Snowflake. The would prefer someone to already have Power BI experience but are open to other visualization tools as well. Snowflake is a nice to have and is not a requirement. As it stands currently, the only data that exists in Snowflake is their ERP data and that is out of necessity because when they try to run reports directly out of their ERP (CMIC) the system gets completely bogged down.
A typical day for this person will include gathering requirements from HR, Finance, and Operations to really understand what they need. This person will not be doing any of the hands on building/development, but will be making sure they understand which tools they should be using, evaluating current tools, and researching new tools that they could possibly leverage in their environment.
The salary range for this position is $115K-$140K and they would entertain contract to hire or direct hire.
