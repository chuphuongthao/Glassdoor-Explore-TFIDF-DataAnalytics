DescriptionDr. Schrauwen at the Center for Statistical Genetics in the Neurology Department is searching for a qualified bioinformatician/computer scientists to aid in a research project focused on the genetic background of neurodevelopmental disorders and other developmental abnormalities. Some of these children endure years-long diagnostic odysseys of trial-and-error testing with inconclusive results and misdirected treatments. The goal of this research is to expand our knowledge on the genetic etiology of these disorders and improve diagnostic testing. The candidate will aid in the analysis of a variety of genetic techniques, including next generation sequencing, long read sequencing, optical genome mapping and epigenomic techniques. We are looking for a talented, passionate, and highly motivated individual to take part in our research mission and to aid in the computational efforts in our group. This is an outstanding opportunity to gain experience to move into a data science career and/or a PhD program.ResponsibilitiesDuties will include, but will not be limited to:Maintain and create bioinformatic pipelines on a high-computing clusterAid in the analysis of novel techniques and novel “omic” data typesParticipate in data interpretation such as data quality control, variant interpretation and classificationUtilize good coding practices including versioning (eg.
