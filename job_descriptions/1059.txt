To solve climate change, wealth inequality, supply chain stability, and national security we must change how our global supply chains work. We are a Trusted Commerce Platform built on a shared source of truth for the global supply chain. Our purpose is to enable resilient, sustainable, secure, and inclusive global commerce: Globalization 2.0.We have built a layer of shared intelligence across the world’s supply chain information: a living map of trillions of dollars of B2B commercial activity, covering 400M companies connected by billions of shipments. This knowledge graph powers Trusted Commerce Platform which, after only three years since founding, is already used by many of the world’s most important governments, enterprises, and logistics providers.Our product suite enables our customers to gain unprecedented visibility, benefit from shared artificial intelligence across a federated network of data, and interact across the network through a shared source of truth.
