Proteomic Bioinformatics Faculty
Applications are invited for a full-time Proteomics Bioinformatician Faculty position at the Assistant or Associate Professor level to join the Innovation Center on Single Cell â€˜Omics & Precision Medicine and the Advanced Clinical BioSystems Research Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC). The Innovation Center is a new initiative launched at CSMC and is established to integrate our top researchers in genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics epigenetics in order to enable fully collaborative, large scale efforts for precision molecular profiling at the single-cell level and high-throughput molecular screening in drug response and genomic perturbation platforms. We are seeking a computational faculty to join this initiative and collaboratively lead efforts in data integration and conversion of proteomic data to knowledge for application of precision science to the definition of individualized disease phenotype, diagnostics, and therapeutics.
The faculty Bioinformatic scientist is expected to build a collegial and collaborative research program that incorporates new strategies for leveraging of quantitative proteomics as well as other complex data sets in proteomics for clinical translational research that transcends traditional research boundaries in developing personalized diagnostics and novel individualize therapies. The faculty Bioinformatics Scientist will be expected to (i) conduct independent, extramurally funded research in their area of medicine, (ii) establish collaborations that amplify the work of other researchers who would benefit from bioinformatics approaches within the context of single cell and high throughput screening, (iii) teach in the graduate program and mentor trainees.
The successful candidate will need a track record of scientific leadership and collaboration, peer-reviewed research and grant funding commensurate with rank, a strong publication history, excellent interpersonal skills, and the ability to thrive in a multi-disciplinary environment. Faculty rank commensurate with experience and an attractive salary package with great career development opportunities and team development will be offered to the successful candidate.
Interested candidates should send their curriculum vitae, names and contact information for five references, and a cover letter describing their career goals and research experience to: Dr. Jennifer Van Eyk, Director, Advanced Clinical BioSystems Research Institute c/o: Academic.Recruiting@cshs.org
