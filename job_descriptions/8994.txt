This retail industry home improvement company is undergoing a transformation and at the center of it is a new experience between people and their homes through emerging data and technologies. The Innovation Labs team plays a critical role in driving this transformation. Because few home project needs can move forward without data about the home, the Innovation Labs is developing new ways to collect and manage home data to meet customers home improvement needs. The primary purpose of this role is to provide advanced analytical capabilities to support data science initiatives. This position gains experience in various areas including, but not limited to: predictive modeling; personalization and recommendation algorithms; natural language processing and text mining; search recall, precision, ranking, and related problems; optimization and mathematical programming with applications in labor scheduling, inventory and capacity planning, network flows, and supply chain optimization. A Senior Data Scientist solves complex problems that do not yet have solutions in the research. Therefore, the individual in this role must be an expert in his/her field and confident in interacting and proposing solutions to the business.
