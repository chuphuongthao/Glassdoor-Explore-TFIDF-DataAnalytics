Today, most organizations are awash in analytics that “aren’t quite right” – models that were developed to generally, or too slowly, to be effective in dynamic, fast-paced environments. Striveworks is simplifying ModelOps with a powerful and extensible platform that instantiates the data analytic process as code.Striveworks is trusted by leading Fortune 500 firms as well as leaders in the public sector to be their primary solution for managing model development, monitoring, and governance – and ensuring those models solve the real challenges their organizations face.Striveworks’ Chariot Platform enables users to turn their own production data into models and turn models into production systems. Uniquely, as you train, test, deploy, and use models, our lineage system enables you to track both the “upstream” provenance of model and data sources, but also the “downstream” usage of the resultant model inferences. Combining this with a highly principled experience for data and model development, Chariot gives our customers in highly regulated industries an unmatched governance solution over the top of a performant ModelOps platform.Striveworks is an Equal Opportunity Employer and does not discriminate in employment on the basis of race, color, religion or belief, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity or expression), national origin, social or ethnic origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information, age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service, or other non-merit factor.
