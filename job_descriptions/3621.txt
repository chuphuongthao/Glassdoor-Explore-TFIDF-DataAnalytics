Job Location: San Ramon
Team Overview
The aim of the Risk and Data Analytics team in the Wildfire Risk organization is to enhance the risk practices of PG&E’s Electric Operation business and thereby address changing external conditions such as climate change. To this end the Risk and Data Analytics team creates and maintains digital tools to enable PG&E to close the gap between metrics and electric system performance. These tools provide a multi-layered view of risk across the electric system so that decision-making processes include and empower employees at all levels of the company to manage risk appropriately.

Sample activities include:
Interpretation and representation of meteorological data in models that combine a range of data sources such as the electric system asset data, vegetation, and meteorology
Prediction of electric distribution equipment failure before it occurs allowing for proactive maintenance
Development of supervised and unsupervised machine learning models using Python and executed in Foundry or AWS

Position Summary

As part of the Risk and Data Analytics team under the Wildfire Risk organization, the Expert Data Scientist collaborates with a multi-disciplinary project team of data scientists, technology experts, and subject matter experts to develop and deploy models quantifying the probability of failure for the electric transmission grid assets. This individual will serve as the technical lead for development and deployment of high complex models utilizing a hybrid of ML and first principles models. This role aims to quantify risk and develop tools to enable risk-informed planning and decision making for electric grid operations
