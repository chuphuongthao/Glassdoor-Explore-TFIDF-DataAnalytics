The team at Stack Education is running hard at closing the gap between what companies demand in skills and capabilities and what universities and colleges are teaching. We believe that higher education institutions should be the centers of lifelong learning in their communities, where students don’t just enroll for a two or four-year degree but are always able to learn and develop new skills. We want to cultivate engaging discussions in the classroom that spillover to the outside world.Stack Education is an equal opportunity employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy and pregnancy-related conditions, or any other characteristic protected by law.Job Types: Part-time, ContractPay: $18.00 - $24.00 per hourSchedule:Day shiftEvening shiftApplication Question(s):Describe your interest in teaching data analytics & data science to newcomers in the field, and why this would be exciting for you.Experience:Data analytics: 2 years (Required)teaching or mentoring: 1 year (Preferred)Work Location: Remote
